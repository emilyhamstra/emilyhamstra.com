    <h2>Employment Experience</h2>
      <h3><i>Kinesiology Librarian, University of Michigan Library, January 2013-present</i></h2>
        <p>As the subject librarian for Kinesiology, I create print and electronic collections that meet the unique needs of faculty and students in the School of Kinesiology. I also provide subject specific research support and teach library instruction sessions.</p>
      <h3><i>Learning Librarian, University of Michigan Library, July 2009-present</i></h2>
        <p>I support the University community in research and learning how to use the library. In addition to staffing the reference desk, I provide reference services over email and chat (IM). I select materials for the Undergraduate Library in a variety of subjects, and maintain the Undergraduate Library's Browsing Collection. I collaboratively select, cancel as needed, and promote electronic collections relevant to undergraduate needs. I teach sessions for undergraduate students about library research skills, and collaborate in event planning. I also maintain the Undergraduate Library website.</p>
      <h3><i>Public Services Associate, University of Michigan Library, August 2007-June 2009</i></h3>
        <p>I provided reference services in-person and over chat (IM). As needed, I led instruction sessions for undergraduate students. I facilitated the presentation at New Student Orientation, reaching nearly 3,000 students in 50 sessions over the summer of 2008. In the summer of 2008, I participated in a major weeding project at the Undergraduate Library, weeding the British and American Literature sections of the library.</p>
