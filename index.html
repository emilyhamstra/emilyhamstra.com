    <h2>Employment Experience</h2>
      <h3><i>Kinesiology Librarian, University of Michigan Library, January 2013-January 2016</i></h2>
      <h3><i>Learning Librarian, University of Michigan Library, July 2009-January 2016</i></h2>
        <p>I supported the university community in research and learning how to use the library. I taught 50-60 library instruction sessions per year. I provided research guidance in-person, by email, and by chat (IM). I maintained the Shapiro Undergraduate Library website. I selected and weeded materials for the Shapiro Undergraduate Library in a variety of subjects. I managed the Browsing Collection, the library’s leisure reading collection. I used this collection to experiment with different models of collecting, including purchasing materials from a local independent bookseller.</p>
        <p>I provided in-depth research assistance to library patrons researching sports, nutrition, and health and wellness. I collected books and journals, print and electronic, for the interdisciplinary research needs of faculty and students in the School of Kinesiology. I taught workshops on advanced research in the health sciences and social sciences, in-person and online.</p>
      <h3><i>Public Services Associate, University of Michigan Library, August 2007-June 2009</i></h3>
        <p>I provided reference services in-person and over chat (IM). As needed, I led instruction sessions for undergraduate students. I facilitated the presentation at New Student Orientation, reaching nearly 3,000 students in 50 sessions over the summer of 2008. In the summer of 2008, I participated in a major weeding project at the Undergraduate Library, weeding the British and American Literature sections of the library.</p>
      <h3><i>Archives Assistant, Grand Rapids Public Library, Grand Rapids, MI, February-July 2007</i></h3>
        <p>During this internship I processed materials and wrote finding aids for collections related to the history of Grand Rapids. I curated a collection of materials from <a href="http://grplpedia.grpl.org/wiki/images/f/f9/252.pdf">local neighborhood associations</a>.</p>
